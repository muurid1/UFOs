# UFOs

## Overview of the project

In this project, we will be editing a webpage to display a table organizing UFO sightings.
In order to perform the analysis, the UFO sightings table will be filtered based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.
JavaScript will be used to create the table, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to modify the website's appearance.

The image below shows how the filter appears when first landing on the page

In the image below, in the addition to the date we were able to filter for a multitude of criteria, at the same time and then we added a table filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings.

## Summary

#### Drawback

The user must know exactly what search criteria they are looking for (dates, cities, states or shapes). The filters require the right spelling. For instance, the city used in this project could not be spelled anything else other than "el cajon" in lower case. (see image below)

#### Recommendations

The filter would be more efficient if we add a grammar corrector, in that case, we will save more time instead of having to figure out the right spelling.

We found out that having a larger range for the date would be really helpful because if we do not have the exact date, we will not get the results we are looking for.
